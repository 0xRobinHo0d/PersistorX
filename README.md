## üß† About

**Persistox** is a Python-based Windows persistence scanning tool I've been working on. It's designed for red teamers and penetration testers, automating the discovery of Windows persistence mechanisms across a target system. Persistox helps uncover and detect potential persistence vectors.

> The goal: Quickly identify persistence vectors that can be exploited **under the current user context**, including checking for write permissions and the needed checks to perform the persistence also the required instructions for the command-line usage.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- ‚úÖ **Writable Check:** Verifies if the current user has write access to registry keys or file paths.
- ‚úÖ **Native Tool Scanning:** Uses `schtasks`, `sc`, `bitsadmin`, `wmic`, and `sdbinst` and other windows native tools to find persistence vectors.
- ‚úÖ **Actionable Output:** Shows whether the method can be used and provides usage commands and instructions on how to leverage it.
- ‚úÖ **Technique Descriptions:** Each persistence method includes a short description .

```
## üîß Options

Option  |Description
----------------|----------------------------------------
-l, --list	| List all available persistence techniques
-m <N>,--method <N>      | Scan a specific technique by its number
-s, --scan	| Scan all the available techniques
--persist-only	| Show only the techniques applicable under the current user contexts

## üí£ Examples
* to List all the available persistence methods:

```python3 persistorx.py --list```

* Scan for a specific method by its number:

```python3 persistorx.py --method 3```

* Scan with all the available techniques:

```python3 persistorx.py --scan```

* Show only applicable persistence vectors for the target:

```bash
python persistorx.py --scan --persist-only```
